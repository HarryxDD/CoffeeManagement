# About the project:

The project's goal is to create an application that can be used to manage a small coffee shop. It will be utilized to cut down on cashiers' manual entry or typing time while also increasing shop productivity. This is also the first time we have supported our own coffee shop at a university event.

The project will include basic café services such as placing orders, printing invoices, verifying, adding, updating, and deleting menu items, and allowing the cafe's owner to view the café's order history. It is anticipated to be enhanced in the future with more statistical elements to help locate a better development path.
